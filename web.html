											<p>
												The
												<em>World Wide Web</em>
												(
												<em>WWW</em>
												, or simply
												<em>Web</em>
												) is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global
												identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI).

											<br />
											<p>
												The Web makes use of a single global identification system: the URI. URIs are a cornerstone of Web
												architecture, providing identification that is common across the Web.
											</p>
											<p>
												By design a URI identifies one resource. We do not limit the scope of what might be a resource. The term
												"resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be identified by a URI. It is conventional on the
												hypertext Web to describe Web pages, images, product catalogs, etc. as “resources”. The distinguishing
												characteristic of these resources is that all of their essential characteristics can be conveyed in a
												message. We identify this set as “information resources.”

												In 2006, the concept of Web 3.0 was introduced during the Technet Summit. Jerry Yang, the founder of Yahoo,
												acknowledged the hardware and software challenges associated with Web 2.0 and proposed the need for a new,
												truly inclusive web platform. He believed that the power of the web had reached a critical point and called
												for a web vehicle that would bridge the gap between professional, and semi-professional users, and
												consumers, encouraging collaborative web interactions and network effects. This new generation of web
												business and applications became known as Web 3.0.

											<p>
												Semantic Web technologies are a set of standards and protocols aimed at enhancing the meaning and
												understanding of data on the World Wide Web. Unlike traditional web technologies that primarily focus on the
												presentation of information, Semantic Web technologies aim to enable machines to comprehend the semantics or
												meaning of data, facilitating more intelligent data processing and interaction. At its core, the Semantic
												Web is based on the principles of annotating data with metadata that describe its meaning and relationships
												in a machine-readable format. This metadata enables automated reasoning, inference, and integration of
												disparate data sources, thereby enabling more sophisticated applications and services.

												work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. In this sense, the Web
												of data enables developing vertical applications that may bring forward specific and sometimes highly
												non-trivial use cases, focusing to provide solutions to problems of different industries, such as Health
												Care and Life Sciences, eGovernment, and Energy, to mention but a few, in order to improve collaboration,

										<h4>TCP/IP and OSI Model</h4>
										<blockquote>
											<p>
												OSI Network Architecture 7 Layers Model Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference model
												developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) in 1984, as a conceptual framework of
												standards for communication in the network across different equipment and applications by different vendors.
												It is now considered the primary architectural model for inter-computing and internetworking communications.
												Most of the network communication protocols used today have a structure based on the OSI model.
											</p>
										</blockquote>

										<blockquote>
											<p><strong>The TCP/IP Protocol Suite</strong></p>
											<p>
												TCP/IP, the protocol on which the Internet is built, is not a single protocol but rather an entire suite of
												related protocols. TCP is even older than Ethernet. It was first conceived in 1969 by the Department of
												Defense. For more on the history of TCP/IP, see the sidebar, “The fascinating story of TCP/IP,” later in
												this chapter. Currently, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) manages the TCP/IP protocol suite.
											</p>
										</blockquote>

										<blockquote>
											<p>
												The TCP/IP suite is based on a four-layer model of networking similar to the seven-layer OSI model. Figure
												1-7 shows how the TCP/IP model matches up with the OSI model and where some of the key TCP/IP protocols fit
												into the model. As you can see, the lowest layer of the model, the network interface layer, corresponds to
												the OSI model's physical and data link layers. TCP/IP can run over a wide variety of network interface layer
												protocols, including Ethernet, as well as other protocols, such as token ring and FDDI (an older standard
												for fiber-optic networks). The application layer of the TCP/IP model corresponds to the upper three layers
												of the OSI model — the session, presentation, and application layers. Many protocols can be used at this
												level. A few of the most popular are HTTP, FTP, Telnet, SMTP, DNS, and SNMP.

											<p><strong>The Transport Layer</strong></p>
											<p>
												TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), is a reliable connection-oriented protocol that allows a byte stream
												originating on one machine to be delivered without error on any other machine in the internet. It segments
												the incoming byte stream into discrete messages and passes each one on to the internet layer. At the
												destination, the receiving TCP process reassembles the received messages into the output stream.
											</p>
											<p><strong>The Application Layer</strong></p>
											<p>
												On top of the transport layer is the application layer. It contains all the higher- level protocols. The
												early ones included virtual terminal (TELNET), file transfer (FTP), and electronic mail (SMTP). Many other
												protocols have been added to these over the years. Some important ones that we will study, shown in Fig.
												1-34, include the Domain Name System (DNS), for mapping host names onto their network addresses, HTTP, the
												protocol for fetching pages on the World Wide Web, and RTP, the protocol for delivering real-time media such

										<blockquote>
											<p>
												Understanding HTTP is critical to the design of advanced web applications. It is a prerequisite for
												utilizing the full power of Internet technologies […] Knowledge of the inner workings of HTTP promotes
												reasoning from first principles, and simplifies the daunting task of learning the rich variety of protocols
												and APIs that depend on its features […] Each HTTP exchange consists of a single request and a single
												response.
											</p>
											<p><strong>Persistent Connections</strong></p>
											<p>
												Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, it does not require persistent connections. A connection is supposed to
												last long enough for a browser to submit a request and receive a response.
											</p>
											<p><strong>Structure of HTTP messages</strong></p>
											<p>
												HTTP messages (both requests and responses) have a structure similar to e-mail messages; that is, they
												consist of a block of lines comprising the message headers, followed by a blank line, followed by a message
												body. However, HTTP messages are not designed for human consumption and have to be expressive enough to
												control HTTP servers, browsers, and proxies.
											</p>
											<p><strong>Request Methods</strong></p>
											<p>
												There are a variety of request methods specified in the HTTP protocol. The most basic ones defined in
												HTTP/1.1 are GET, HEAD, and POST. In addition, there are the less commonly used PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS,
												and CONNECT.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong><em>GET method</em></strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												GET is the simplest of the request methods. When you type a URL in your browser, follow a bookmark, or click
												on a hyperlink to visit another page, the browser uses the GET method when making the request to the web
												server.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong><em>Processing HTTP Requests</em></strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												The act of sending an HTTP request to a web server consists of three basic steps: constructing the HTTP
												request (Request Generation module), establishing a connection (Networking module) across the Internet to
												the target server or an intermediate proxy, and transmitting the request (Networking module) over the
												established connection.
											</p>
											<p>
												<strong><em>Processing HTTP Responses</em></strong>
											</p>
											<p>
												An HTTP response message consists of a status line (containing the HTTP version, a three-digit status code,
												and a brief human-readable explanation of the status code), a series of headers (one per line), a blank
												line, and finally the body of the response.

										<h4>APIs and GraphQL</h4>
										<blockquote>
											<p>
												In the dynamic landscape of modern web development, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a pivotal
												role, enabling seamless communication between different software components and services. […] As the
												backbone of modern web applications, APIs are essential for connecting diverse systems, enabling developers
												to harness the power of third-party services, and fostering interoperability. […] REST (Representational
												State Transfer) is a fundamental architectural style that underpins many of the APIs that we interact with
												daily. The client-server model is at the heart of REST, defining clear roles and responsibilities for both
												clients and servers. APIs also encourage modularity, reusability, and collaboration among development teams.
												Rather than building everything from scratch, developers can focus on their core competencies and utilize
												APIs to handle specialized tasks such as payment processing, authentication, geolocation, and more.

												In 2010, Ethan Marcotte gave name to another, more flexible solution in his article “Responsive Web Design”
												(alistapart.com/article/responsive-webdesign), which has since become a cornerstone of modern web design. In
												this chapter, I will follow the “ingredients” for RWD that Ethan outlines in his book Responsive Web Design
												(A Book Apart).
											</p>
											<p>The technique has three core components:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													A flexible grid Rather than remaining at a static width, responsive sites use methods that allow them to
													squeeze and flow into the available browser space.
												</li>
												<li>
													Flexible images Images and other embedded media need to be able to scale to fit their containing elements.
												</li>
												<li>
													CSS media queries Media queries give us a way to deliver sets of rules only to devices that meet certain
													criteria, such as width and orientation.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												To this list of ingredients, I would add the viewport meta element, which makes the width of the web page
												match the width of the screen. That's where we'll begin our tour of the mechanics of RWD.

												We can make the page more mobile friendly by adding this snippet in the
												<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
												:
											</p>
											<!-- prettier-ignore -->
											<pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;</code></pre>

											<p>
												This viewport meta tag is the non-standard but de facto way of telling the browser how to render the page.
												Although introduced to the web by Apple, rather than a standard process, it remains essential for responsive
												web design.

											<p>
												Git is a technology that can be used to track changes to a project and to help multiple people to
												collaborate on a project. At a basic level, a project version controlled by Git consists of a folder with
												files in it, and Git tracks the changes that are made to the files in the project. This allows you to save
												different versions of the work you're doing, which is why we call Git a version control system.
											</p>
											<p>
												Git was created by Linus Torvalds to version control the work done on a large software development project
												called the Linux kernel. However, since Git can track changes to all sorts of files, it can be used for a
												wide variety of projects.
